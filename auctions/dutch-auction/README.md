This is an implementation of a Dutch Auction in Sway. A dutch auction is one where price falls gradually from an initially high price, and the first person to bid wins the auction.

Price cannot fall below the reserve price, and the price falls linearly from the start_time to the end_time.

Multiple auctions can occur simultaneously.
